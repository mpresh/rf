Definitions and data
--------------------

Primary data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Impressions

  A metric of the number of views; the audience size.  If user A has 300
  friends on facebook, then the impression count for his share is 300. 

* Responses (clicks)

  The number of people who've responded to and clicked. This is a useful upper 
  bound on the number of tickets purchased through ripplefunction. 

* Reach

  The number of unique people the message is delivered to. Impressions is a
  better metric because multiple exposures to the same destination website or
  event page are not necessarily accompanied by exposure to the same status
  post/tweet message and link.

Secondary and derived data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Reshares

  If user B clicks on a link posted by user A, and then also reposts or
  retweets, this is called a reshare.  This is a good indicator of how many
  actual purchases were made through ripplefunction promotion.

  Reshares are also useful for guaging how viral the promotion is on twitter
  and facebook. ``Virality'' metrics include depth (of the reshare tree; number
  of reshares) and breath (per user is impressions and clicks; w.r.t. reshares,
  a metric of the spread per generation in the reshare tree, with originating
  user at the root).

* Total impressions w.r.t. originating user

  The total number of nodes in the reshare tree.

* Total responses w.r.t. originating user

  The total number of clicks in the reshare tree.

* Total reach w.r.t. originating user

  The number of unique users reached w.r.t.  originating user.


Other terms
-----------

* Originating user(s)

  And originating user is a user who has shared an event without
  resharing. That is, he is the first person to have shared from a widget or
  landing page. The number is, like many metrics above, not air tight and
  completely disjoint from other metrics, but likely accurate.


Tree
----

For historical tracking of data, ripplefunction could track not only the counts
above, but the actual paths of the reshare tree. This would be useful only if
the tree contains data which is useful but not captured through a number, and
if there are doubts about having exhaustively extracted all useful data from
the tree. Both are likely to be true. Storage is the only resource constraint
that arouses concern.


Interesting data and points to consider
---------------------------------------

* Identify "strong" nodes and subtrees in the tree
  - Find ways to encourage and maintain strong promoters

* Find heuristic ways to guage competitor market share
  and influence
  - Find ways to encroach on their piece of the pie
