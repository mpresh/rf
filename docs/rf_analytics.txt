Definitions and data
--------------------

Primary data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Impressions

  A metric of the number of views; the audience size.  If user A has 300
  friends on facebook, then the impression count for his share is 300. 

* Responses (clicks)

  The number of people who've responded, i.e. clicked. This number can be
  interpreted as a working lower bound on the number of tickets purchased
  through ripplefunction. Obviously not all who click will purchase a ticket,
  and few will probably purchase a ticket without resharing to receive a
  discount, but it is likely to provide a reasonable indication of at least how
  many purchases were made because of our widget. A strict lower bound is zero.

* Reach

  The number of unique people the message is delivered to. Impressions is a
  better metric because multiple exposures to the same destination website or
  event page are not necessarily accompanied by exposure to the same status
  post/tweet message and link.

Secondary and derived data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Reshares

  If user B clicks on a link posted by user A, and then also reposts or
  retweets, this is called a reshare.  This can be interpreted as a good
  estimate of how many actual purchases were made through ripplefunction
  promotion, or a reasonable upper bound (a strict upper bound is the number of
  tickets purchased online, a number to which we don't have access).

  Reshares are also useful for guaging how viral the promotion is on twitter
  and facebook. ``Virality'' metrics include depth (of the reshare tree; number
  of reshares) and breath (per user is impressions and clicks; w.r.t. reshares,
  a metric of the spread per generation in the reshare tree, with originating
  user at the root).

* Total impressions w.r.t. originating user

  The total number of nodes in the reshare tree.

* Total responses w.r.t. originating user

  The total number of clicks in the reshare tree.

* Total reach w.r.t. originating user

  The number of unique users reached w.r.t.  originating user.


Other terms
-----------

* Originating user(s)

  And originating user is a user who has shared an event without
  resharing. That is, he is the first person to have shared from a widget or
  landing page. The number is, like many metrics above, not air tight and
  completely disjoint from other metrics, but likely accurate. For example,
  since promotional codes remain fixed at the moment, it is possible for people
  to share the promotional code among themselves without the knowledge of
  ripplefunction.


Tree
----

For historical tracking of data, ripplefunction could track not only the counts
above, but the actual paths of the reshare tree. This would be useful only if
the tree contains data which is useful but not captured through a number, and
if there are doubts about having exhaustively extracted all useful data from
the tree. Both are likely to be true. Storage is the only resource constraint
that arouses concern.


Interesting data and points to consider
---------------------------------------

* Identify "strong" nodes and subtrees in the tree
  - Find ways to encourage and maintain strong promoters

* Find heuristic ways to guage competitor market share
  and influence
  - Find ways to encroach on their piece of the pie

* Learn what kind of events a particular user tends to prefer. This can be
  useful for informing clients of particular user characteristics. Since we
  have access to facebook, we can make use of profile information as well.
